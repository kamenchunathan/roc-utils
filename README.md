# roc-utils

Miscellaneous utility functions for the Roc language. I wrote these as an exercise to learn the language. They're not optimized in any way, but as far as I can tell they work correctly.

* `Hex` — convert between bytes and hex strings
* `Base64` — encode and decode base64 strings
* `Sha` — compute SHA 256 hashes
* `Hmac` — HMAC-SHA 256 message authentication
